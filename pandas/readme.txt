Yelp_review_ML_model:
I conducted a comprehensive NLP analysis to classify text data, involving data preparation,
exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training. After loading and
cleaning the dataset, I visualized data distributions and relationships using histograms,
box plots, and heatmaps. I created a machine learning pipeline incorporating text vectorization
and trained a classification model, evaluating its performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
The model demonstrated good overall performance, though there's room for optimization with 
advanced techniques and balancing strategies.

Airbnb & Snappy Shopper notebooks are to demonstrate my data cleaning, transformation and visualisation skills using pandas.
